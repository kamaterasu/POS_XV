# Backup of inventory page responsive updates

I need to restore the original file structure and apply the responsive changes more carefully.

The original file was very long (2665+ lines) and complex. I attempted to make it responsive but broke the JSX structure.

Key changes that were intended:

1. Better mobile header layout with improved spacing and button sizes
2. Mobile-friendly search and filter sections
3. Improved categories panel for mobile devices
4. Better responsive breakpoints throughout
5. Touch-friendly buttons and interactions

The file needs to be restored to working state before continuing with responsive improvements.
